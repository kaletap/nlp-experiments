# Code for my master thesis
## Week 1 (7-11 September)
* look at 'Deep Latent Sequence Model' and understand it (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03912)
* run deep-latent-sequence-model (https://github.com/cindyxinyiwang/deep-latent-sequence-model):
  find a way to translate one sentence into another
* implement sentiment classification model on a different dataset
* figure out how to run stuff on the cloud easily

## Week 2 (14-18 September)
* how to *evaluate* unsupervised style transfer?
* write evaluation scripts/notebooks

## Week 3 (21-25 September)
* look for other easily available style-transfer models and compare them
* generate nice latex tables with results

## Ideas
* after implementing sentiment model, test how well it does with
  corrupted sentences (robustness)
* ideas for the cloud: GCP ($$), colab (free, but annoying), 
  aws ($$ and very annoying), gpunode@mini.pw.edu.pl (free, but pretty much useless)
